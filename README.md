# Customer Churn Prediction Project

This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning models. It uses a dataset containing various customer-related features, such as demographics, account information, and activity levels, to identify customers likely to leave a bank.

## Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical issue for businesses as it directly impacts revenue and growth. By predicting which customers are likely to churn, businesses can take proactive measures to retain them.

This project involves:
1. **Data Cleaning:** Preparing the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numeric features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding the distribution of data and relationships between features.
3. **Model Building:** Developing machine learning models to predict churn and evaluating their performance.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing model performance through hyperparameter tuning.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:

- **RowNumber:** Unique identifier for each row.
- **CustomerId:** Unique customer ID.
- **Surname:** Customer surname (anonymized).
- **CreditScore:** Customer credit score.
- **Geography:** Customer's country or region.
- **Gender:** Customer's gender.
- **Age:** Customer's age.
- **Tenure:** Number of years the customer has been with the bank.
- **Balance:** Customer's account balance.
- **NumOfProducts:** Number of products purchased by the customer.
- **HasCrCard:** Whether the customer has a credit card (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
- **IsActiveMember:** Whether the customer is an active member (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
- **EstimatedSalary:** Customer's estimated salary.
- **Exited:** Target variable indicating if the customer has churned (1 = Yes, 0 = No).

Modeling

The following machine learning techniques were used to predict customer churn:

Random Forest Classifier: This model was chosen for its ability to handle both classification and regression problems, as well as its effectiveness in managing high-dimensional datasets.
Other models (e.g., Logistic Regression, XGBoost) can also be experimented with for comparison.

Model Evaluation
The model's performance was evaluated using the following metrics:

Accuracy
Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)
ROC AUC Score
ROC Curve
Results

Accuracy: The trained model achieved an accuracy of X% on the test set.
ROC AUC Score: The ROC AUC score was Y, indicating that the model performed well in distinguishing between churn and non-churn customers.
Future Work

Feature Engineering: Explore additional features that may improve model performance.
Advanced Models: Experiment with advanced models like Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks, or ensemble methods to further enhance predictions.
Deploy the Model: Deploy the churn prediction model using tools like Flask or Django for real-time prediction.
